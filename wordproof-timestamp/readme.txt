Timestamp your WordPress content on the blockchain to proof trust. No blockchain knowledge needed.

== Description ==

### WordProof: Timestamp your WordPress Content on the Blockchain

> “In five years from now, if you don’t timestamp your articles on the blockchain, you’re going to be considered a fraud.” - Brendan Blumer

With WordProof Timestamp, you can sign your WordPress content on any EOSIO blockchain from the comfort of your WordPress site. No prior blockchain experience necessary: the WordProof Setup Wizard helps you with everything, right from your WordPress dashboard.

### Why do I need to timestamp my content?

There are hundreds of millions of websites. However, there are only a few websites visitors accept information from, let alone do business with. This is because they trust those websites. You gain the trust of your visitors by doing two things differently than your competition:

* Claim ownership of your content
* Show transparency to your visitors

WordProof Timestamp makes both these things possible with the power of blockchain.
